Hi, I am Garvit Banga, a second-year Master's Student in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, working with Prof. Qi Lei on Federated Learning for Domain Adaptation using MGDA. I am also working closely with Prof. Aritra Dutta on Federated Learning with Bandwidth-Aware Gradient Compression for Multimodal Clients.

I received my Bachelor in Technology from Indian Institute of Technology, (BHU), Varanasi in 2021 where I worked with Prof. Hari Prabhat Gupta and Prof. Rahul Mishra on Resource Aware Clustering for Tackling the Heterogeneity of Participants in Federated Learning.

You can find my [CV](https://garvitbanga.github.io/files/GarvitBangaCV.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XkW4KCkAAAAJ&hl=en) here.
