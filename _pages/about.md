Hi, I am Garvit Banga, a second-year Master's Student in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at <b>New York University</b>, working with <b>Prof. Qi Lei</b> on Federated Learning for Domain Adaptation using MGDA. I am also working closely with <b>Prof. Aritra Dutta</b> from <b>University of Central Florida</b> on Federated Learning with Bandwidth-Aware Gradient Compression for Multimodal Clients.

I received my Bachelor in Technology from <b>Indian Institute of Technology, (BHU), Varanasi</b> in 2021 where I worked with <b>Prof. Hari Prabhat Gupta</b> and <b>Prof. Rahul Mishra</b> on Resource Aware Clustering for Tackling the Heterogeneity of Participants in Federated Learning.

You can find my [CV](https://garvitbanga.github.io/files/GarvitBangaCV.pdf) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XkW4KCkAAAAJ&hl=en) here.
